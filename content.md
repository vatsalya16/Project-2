## About

1.  Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is the most popular hot drink in the world.

2.  Seeds of the Coffee plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

3.  The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.

4.  Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions, such as infusions from green coffee beans,coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted.
